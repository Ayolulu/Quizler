Quizler - Interactive Quiz Application
Overview
Quizler is an engaging quiz application built with Python, designed to provide a fun and educational experience. I used API parameters and utilized my knowledge of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and GUI development to create this project. This app fetches trivia questions from the Open Trivia Database API and presents them through a vibrant and intuitive interface. I developed Quizler to play with my friends and to practice and showcase the knowledge I have gained while learning Python.
